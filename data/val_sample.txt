Parliament Does Not Support Amendment Freeing Tymoshenko
Today , the Ukraine parliament dismissed , within the Code of Criminal Procedure amendment , the motion to revoke an article based on which the opposition leader , Yulia Tymoshenko , was sentenced .
The amendment that would lead to freeing the imprisoned former Prime Minister was revoked during second reading of the proposal for mitigation of sentences for economic offences .
In October , Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for entering into what was reported to be a disadvantageous gas deal with Russia .
The verdict is not yet final; the court will hear Tymoshenko &apos;s appeal in December .
Tymoshenko claims the verdict is a political revenge of the regime; in the West , the trial has also evoked suspicion of being biased .
The proposal to remove Article 365 from the Code of Criminal Procedure , upon which the former Prime Minister was sentenced , was supported by 147 members of parliament .
Its ratification would require 226 votes .
Libya &apos;s Victory
The story of Libya &apos;s liberation , or rebellion , already has its defeated .
Muammar Kaddafi is buried at an unknown place in the desert . Without him , the war is over .
It is time to define the winners .
As a rule , Islamists win in the country; the question is whether they are the moderate or the radical ones .
The transitional cabinet declared itself a follower of the customary Sharia law , of which we have already heard .
Libya will become a crime free country , as the punishment for stealing is having one &apos;s hand amputated .
Women can forget about emancipation; potential religious renegades will be executed; etc .
Instead of a dictator , a society consisting of competing tribes will be united by Koran .
Libya will be in an order we cannot imagine and surely would not ask for .
However , our lifestyle is neither unique nor the best one and would not , most probably , be suitable for , for example , the people of Libya .
In fact , it is a wonder that the Islamic fighters accepted help from the nonbelievers .
Their only excuse is that from their point of view , NATO raids were not controlled by an American general , but Allah , the greatness of whom they celebrated with each strike .
